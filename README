NAME
    OpenBSD::Pledge - Perl interface to OpenBSD pledge(2)

SYNOPSIS
      use OpenBSD::Pledge;
      my $file = "/usr/share/dict/words";
      pledge(qw( rpath ), [$file]) || die "Unable to pledge: $!";

      open my $fh, '<', $file or die "Unable to open $file: $!\n";
      while ( readline($fh) ) {
        print if /pledge/i;
      }
      close $fh;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a perl interface to OpenBSD's pledge(2) syscall(2).

    Once you promise that your program will only use certain syscalls the
    kernel will kill the program if it attempts to call any other
    interfaces.

  EXPORT
    Exports "pledge" by default.

    ":all" will also export "pledgenames"

METHODS
  pledge(@promises, [\@paths])
    With pledge(2) you can promise what abilities your program will need.
    You can pledge multiple times with more restrictive promises, but
    abilities can never be regained.

    This interface always promises "stdio" because perl(1) itself uses some
    of the provided system calls.

    You can supply an optional array reference of paths to be used as a
    whitelist, all other paths will appear not to exist. You may only limit
    the paths once.

    Returns true on success, returns false and sets $! on failure.

  pledgenames
    Returns a list of the possible promises you can pass to "pledge".

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Perl is particularly fond of "stdio" so that promise is always added by
    "pledge".
